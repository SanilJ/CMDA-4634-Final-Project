# cu DCGANS
Exploring DCGANS in Pytorch with a focus on optimizing for a GPU as a final project for CMDA 4634

data -> the dataset data 

Instructions:
There is a .zip file in the data/art directory. Extract it as a directory called abstract gallary which staying in the art directory. 

gan-cpu -> This is the cpu version of the DCGAN model
gan-gpu -> This is the gpu version of the DCGANs model with optimizations
