# cu DCGANS
Exploring DCGANS in Pytorch with a focus on optimizing for a GPU as a final project for CMDA 4634

data -> the dataset data, you have to extra the data from the Kaggle
gan-cpu -> This is the cpu version of the DCGAN model
gan-gpu -> This is the gpu version of the DCGANs model with optimizations  
Summary -> the pdf talks about the project in detail

Recommended Way of Running Code:
I recommend running the code in Colab or a similar environment unless you have a GPU. Simply upload the code in colab and get the data from the Abstract Art Gallary Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bryanb/abstract-art-gallery).
